# My JavaScript Learning Journey and Mini Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey! In this repository, I've documented my ongoing progress as I explore the world of JavaScript. Additionally, I've created and shared mini projects like a basic calculator, a to-do app, and a bubble game to showcase my learning and development skills.

## Learning Goals
My primary goal in learning JavaScript was to gain a strong foundation in web development and enhance my coding skills. Specifically, I aimed to:

- Understand the core concepts of JavaScript, including variables, data types, functions, and control flow.
- Explore the Document Object Model (DOM) and learn how to manipulate web pages using JavaScript.
- Create interactive web applications and simple games to apply what I've learned.

## Learning Resources
Throughout my learning journey, I've relied on various resources to expand my knowledge of JavaScript:

- **Online Tutorials:** I started with online tutorials and courses, including Codecademy, MDN Web Docs, and freeCodeCamp.
- **Books:** I've read "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke, which provided a deep dive into the language.
- **Community:** Engaging with the coding community on forums like Stack Overflow and GitHub was immensely helpful for problem-solving and learning from others.
- **Projects:** I've built mini projects and games to apply what I've learned hands-on.

## Mini Projects
Here's a brief overview of the mini-projects I've created to showcase my JavaScript skills:

1. [**Basic Calculator:**](https://github.com/krunal-gamit/caclulator-basic) I built a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations, making use of JavaScript's math functions and event handling. [Live Project](https://krunal-gamit.github.io/caclulator-basic/)


2. [**To-Do App:**](https://github.com/krunal-gamit/todoApp-basic) I developed a to-do list application that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. It incorporates local storage to save tasks for future sessions. [Live Project](https://krunal-gamit.github.io/todoApp-basic/)

3. [**Bubble Game:**](https://github.com/krunal-gamit/bubbleGame-medium) In my bubble-popping game, players need to pop bubbles before the timer runs out. It features dynamic bubble generation and a scoring system. [Live Project](https://krunal-gamit.github.io/bubbleGame-medium/)


## Key Takeaways
Here are some of the key takeaways from my JavaScript learning journey:

1. **Fundamental Concepts:** I've grasped fundamental JavaScript concepts, such as variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements.

2. **DOM Manipulation:** Understanding the DOM and how to manipulate HTML and CSS through JavaScript has been a significant achievement. Building interactive web applications like the to-do app and bubble game highlighted this.

3. **Problem-Solving:** JavaScript has taught me problem-solving skills and how to approach coding challenges systematically.

## Challenges Faced
Learning JavaScript wasn't without its challenges. Some of the hurdles I encountered included:

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Understanding asynchronous code and concepts like callbacks and promises was initially challenging.
- **Scope and Closures:** It took time to fully comprehend JavaScript's scope and closure mechanisms.
- **Debugging:** Debugging complex JavaScript code was often a time-consuming process, but it improved with practice.

## Future Plans
My journey in JavaScript is ongoing. Here are my future plans:

- Continue building more complex web applications and games.
- Explore JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js.
- Contribute to open-source projects to further enhance my skills.

## Conclusion
My JavaScript learning journey has been both rewarding and challenging. I'm excited to continue growing as a web developer and exploring the vast world of JavaScript. Thank you for joining me on this adventure!
